# rock-paper-scissors-ui-version

This program allows user to play rock, paper, scissors using buttons instead of responses typed in a prompt.

The page will initially display "Round 1", and a empty scoreboard with 3 buttons labeled "Rock", "Paper", and "Scissors".

Upon press a button the page will display the player and computer choice, the results of the round, aswell as updating the round and scoreboard.

Once the 5th round is reached, the results of the game will be displayed, telling the user who won the best out of 5 rounds along with a button labeled "Play Again" which resets the UI and restarts the game.
